### Implement Data Channel Communication

In addition to setting up the WebRTC peer-to-peer connection for video and audio, establish a Data Channel between the peers using the same JavaScript library (e.g., PeerJS or Simple-Peer). Create a Django view to handle file uploads or contact information submission from the client-side. Use the Data Channel to transmit the file data or contact information from the sender to the receiver(s).

### Handle File Uploads

- On the client-side, provide a user interface (e.g., a file input field) to allow users to select files for upload.
- When a file is selected, read the file data and transmit it through the Data Channel to the intended recipient(s).
- On the receiving end, handle the incoming file data, save it to the server's file system or a cloud storage service, and notify the recipient(s) of the new file.

### Handle Contact Information Sharing

- Create a form or input fields in your Django template to allow users to enter their contact information (e.g., name, email, phone number).
- When the user submits the contact information, send it through the Data Channel to the intended recipient(s).
- On the receiving end, handle the incoming contact information and store it in your database or display it to the recipient(s).

### Implement Access Control and Notifications

- Ensure that only authorized users can share files or contact information with others.
- Implement notifications or alerts to inform recipients when they receive a new file or contact information.

### Consider File Storage and Handling

- Decide on a suitable file storage solution, such as the server's file system, a cloud storage service (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage), or a content delivery network (CDN).
- Implement file handling mechanisms, such as virus scanning, file type validations, and size limitations, to ensure security and prevent abuse.

### Enhance User Experience

- Implement progress bars or indicators to show the status of file uploads or downloads.
- Provide previews or thumbnails for shared files, if applicable.
- Allow users to share multiple files or contact information in a single session.

### Testing and Deployment

- Thoroughly test the file sharing and contact information sharing functionality locally and on a staging environment.
- Ensure that the necessary security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access or data leaks.
- Deploy the updated application to your production environment.
